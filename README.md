Converted TypeScript project
----------------------------
This project was automatically converted from JavaScript to TypeScript files by:
- Renaming .js/.jsx -> .ts/.tsx
- Prepending `// @ts-nocheck` to converted files to suppress TypeScript errors for a smooth migration.

Next steps to run:
1. cd into the project
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

Notes:
- Please review converted files and replace `// @ts-nocheck` with proper types gradually.
- If you want a full strict-typed conversion, I can continue and add appropriate interfaces/types for each file.
